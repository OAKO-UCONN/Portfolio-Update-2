# 2nd_Project_Full_Stack

This Project is called Dine-Now! Dine-Now was made to help people connect and find restaurants with available tables. It was also made for restuarant managers so they can manage their tables and time limits if they have limited seating.

This is a node.js application. To start clone the repository. Once cloned make sure you have VsCodium or VsCode. I prefer VsCodium because its the Free Open Source version of VsCode without telemetry. Now that you have VsCodium or VsCode installed open the terminal and run "npm -i" this command will initialize your packages. Once your packages are installed run in the same terminal "node server.js" It will tell you the port number. Go to your browser and type "http://localhost:portnumber" replace portnumber with the port number that the node.js terminal set it as. Now the application is running!

This Project connects to Heroku and uses an SQL Database. To view the Database download and Install MySQL Workbench.
